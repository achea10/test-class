      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
         The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2001 by members Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals). Mark Stoermer (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. (drums, percussion) would complete the current line-up of the band in 2002. The band's name is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band, portrayed in the music video for the New Order song "Crystal".
